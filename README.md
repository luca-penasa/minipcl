# MINIPCL

**minipcl** is a highly reduced, drop-in replacement of the fairly big [PCL](http::pointclouds.org) library.
This smaller lib basically includes some code from `common` and `io` PCL modules.

The idea is to have only basic PCL types and IO methods.

**minipcl** is useful if you just use PCL for reading/saving PCD, PLY, OBJ, ... file formats. 
In fact  it allows you to load these format into a `PCLPointCloud2` or into `pcl::PointCloud<PointT>` point clouds. 
Then you can convert these format to your type or to `Eigen` matrixes, and do whatever you need with the loaded data.

minipcl is generated by a really-raw python script which checkout last commis from PCL and then copy required files into the minipcl folder. 
You can run it like this (you dont really need to but...):

```bash
./generate.py
```

Notice that you will need python >= 3.2 for some specific functions to work.


The nice thing is that **minipcl** does have many dependencies: only **boost** and **Eigen** are required.
